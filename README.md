Database System for an Online Caregivers Platform

# Project Summary: Online Caregivers Platform Implementation

In this project, I designed and implemented an Online Caregivers Platform, focusing on constructing a robust database model and demonstrating practical application skills. The project aimed to simulate real-world scenarios in caregiver services, emphasizing efficient database utilization rather than user interface design.

**Bulletpoints**:
1. **Database Design:**
   - Constructed a physical database using PostgreSQL, aligning with the specified schema.
   - Utilized a relational database model with tables such as USER, CAREGIVER, MEMBER, ADDRESS, JOB, JOB_APPLICATION, and APPOINTMENT.

2. **Caregiver and Family Registration:**
   - Implemented user registration for caregivers and family members, capturing essential details like name, contact information, caregiving type, and location.
   - Ensured security through password protection for both caregivers and family members.

3. **Caregiver and Family Profile Management:**
   - Developed caregiver profiles containing information such as gender, hourly rate, and caregiving type.
   - Enabled family members to specify house rules and additional details about the person in need of care.

4. **Job Advertisement and Application:**
   - Facilitated family members in posting detailed job advertisements, including criteria such as preferred time intervals and frequency of caregiving services.
   - Caregivers could view job advertisements, apply, and provide necessary information during the application process.

5. **Search and Matching:**
   - Enabled family members to search for caregivers based on caregiving type and city.
   - Implemented a matching system, allowing family members to view profiles of caregivers that meet their specified conditions.

6. **Appointment Management:**
   - Implemented a robust appointment system where family members could schedule appointments with caregivers.
   - Caregivers could confirm or decline appointment requests, and once confirmed, contact information was shared between both parties.
   - Integrated a feature for members to view their upcoming appointments.

7. **Data Population:**
   - Inserted diverse and meaningful data instances into each table, ensuring a non-empty result set for queries.

This project not only enhanced my database modeling skills but also provided practical insights into the development of applications reliant on efficient database structures.
